Students will explore the principles, methods, and techniques used in systems development so that they can create system models using appropriate industry tools. As a part of creating system models, students will also learn to effectively communicate technical concepts and design decisions to various audiences in a professional manner.

    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
      The client, DriverPass, wants to design a system that can provide resources to students to help them better prepare for and pass their driving test. 
      
    What did you do particularly well? If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
       I believe I did well across the whole project, however the UML diagrams could use some more details. 
      
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
       The user’s and clients’ needs were interpreted from the client meeting transcript, based on this transcript the program was implemented with all of the           client requirements. 
       
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
      By following the processes and using the tools that we learned from our reading I was able to break the project down, making sure that all necessary             components were included
